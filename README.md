# InsightFlow

InsightFlow is an end-to-end data to intelligence pipeline.

The goal of this project is to start with messy, real-world data and
progressively transform it into trustworthy, structured, and intelligent
outputs using data engineering, machine learning, and AI techniques.

## Current Stage
Building a clean, defensive data ingestion layer.

## Why This Matters
Before data can power insights or intelligence, it needs to be trustworthy.
